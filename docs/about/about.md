Hi, I'm Ibrahim, and I am a Mathematics undergrad in [Bilkent](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). I am an embedded software engineer at [TDG Earthquake and Structural Health Monitoring Systems](https://tdg.com.tr/en).

I have been interested in programming since I was 11. For the last 6-7 years, I developed a particular interest in embedded systems. I began my embedded journey with a Raspberry Pi that classifies sea trash using PyTorch in 2018.

After I got a job at TDG, I started learning Yocto, Linux kernel development, DevOps processes, and consumer IoT features (A/B updating, telemetry, etc.). I write device drivers, kernel patches for various subystems and userspace applications for real-time data processing.
