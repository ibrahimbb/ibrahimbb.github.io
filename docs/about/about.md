Hi, I'm Ibrahim and am a Mathmetics undergrad in [Bilkent](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). I currently work as an embedded software engineer at a company called [TDG Earthquake and Structural Health Monitoring Systems](https://tdg.com.tr/en).

I am interested in any type of programming since I was 11. For the last 6-7 years, I developed a special interest in embedded systems. I started my embedded journey with a Raspberry Pi that classifies sea trash using PyTorch in 2018.

After I got a job at TDG, I started learning Yocto, Linux kernel development, DevOPS processes, and consumer IoT features (A/B updating, telemetry etc.). I write device drivers, kernel patches for various subystems and userspace applications for real-time data processing.
